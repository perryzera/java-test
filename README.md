Hey there,

This is my Developer Test for Meisters Solutions.

As I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Java, but I did my best to work through it.

I couldn't fully solve exercise 4 because I'm still gaining experience, but as I mentioned during the interview, I'm eager to learn and ready to tackle new challenges.

Thank you so much, and have a great day!
